            <p style="color: rgb(8,10,11);font-size: 19px;"><br><strong>Health or medical insurance</strong>&nbsp;shields the primary policyholder from financial cost of hospitalization arising out of an accident, sudden illness or planned hospitalization. Insurance companies cover policyholders and
                their family with the facility of cashless hospitalisation or offer to reimburse any medical expenses incurred during the policy period.Insurance providers tie-up with a group of partnered hospitals, known as network hospitals. Through
                these hospitals you can avail cashless treatment for medical and surgical expenses. Generally, insurance companies offer to reimburse hospitalization costs of non-network hospitals. The government of India also encourages citizens to avail
                a health insurance by offering tax exemptions on health insurance under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961.Healthcare and wellness expenses are rising every day. Hence, a well covered health insurance in India has become one of the
                basic requirements. Depending on the type of health insurance plan, you can avail different types of coverage for expenses related to surgical, critical illness, hospital, diagnosis, etc.<br><br></p>
            <h1 style="color: rgb(251,251,252);">Importance of Health Insurance Policy:<br></h1>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;color: rgb(8,10,11);"><br>It’s not just a good idea to buy a health insurance plan, but it’s a necessity due to the ever-increasing costs of medical care. It acts as a financial cover arising out of emergency hospitalisation of self or any member of your family.
                By overlooking a health cover, it could possibly lead to a dent in your savings or you may even have to borrow funds for the unexpected hospitalization.Medical emergencies come unannounced and with medical care becoming increasingly expensive,
                it’s imperative to opt for health insurance and purchase a policy which will cover members of your family as well.<br><br></p>
